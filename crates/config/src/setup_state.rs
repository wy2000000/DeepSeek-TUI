//! Unified setup-state model for the v0.8.67 constitution-first setup lane
//! (#3403).
//!
//! This is the single record every setup step (#3404–#3412) reads and writes so
//! that "configured", "skipped", "verified", and "ready" mean the same thing
//! everywhere. It is persisted as a JSON sidecar (`setup_state.json`) under
//! `$CODEWHALE_HOME`, written atomically through [`crate::persistence`] so it is
//! independent of `config.toml`'s comment-preserving writes and can never leave
//! a half-written file.
//!
//! The record holds two things:
//!
//! 1. A per-[`SetupStep`] [`StepEntry`] (status, required, safe summary,
//!    writing lane version).
//! 2. The constitution-first fields the wizard, the update checkpoint, and
//!    `/constitution` all coordinate on.
//!
//! Readiness is a *derived* property ([`first_run_ready`](SetupState::first_run_ready)
//! / [`update_ready`](SetupState::update_ready)); it is never persisted, so the
//! rules can evolve without a migration.
//!
//! Secrets never appear here: [`StepEntry::result`] is a short human-facing
//! summary (provider name, model id, mode name), never a key.
